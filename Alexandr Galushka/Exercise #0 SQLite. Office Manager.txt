The task of calculating the time of work of an office manager.

  This query chooses in data base those messages that have been sent/received within the 24 hours 
(starting from the moment of launching) and groups them by five-minute intervals. 
Farther calculated sum of the wasted time for reading/writing a messages.
Was used statistical average data about reading/writing text by people`s. 
Here the constant 0.6833 is a average writing speed, 3.3333 is a average reading speed. 


select sum(ResultTime), datetime(TimeStamp/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') from 
	(select TimeStamp, datetime(TimeStamp/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as Time, Body,   
		case when ContactID is 1
		then (length(Body) - length(replace(Body, ' ', '')) + 1) / 0.6833
		else (length(Body) - length(replace(Body, ' ', '')) + 1) / 3.3333
		end as ResultTime from
			(select * from EventInfo where datetime(TimeStamp/1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime')
				between
					datetime(strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 day'), 'unixepoch', 'localtime')
					and
					datetime(strftime('%s', 'now'), 'unixepoch', 'localtime')
			)
		) group by strftime('%s', 'now') - (TimeStamp/1000) / 300
